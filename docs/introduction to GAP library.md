# Introduction to Zephyr API: Generic Access Profile (GAP)
In Zephyr OS, the `zephyr/bluetooth/gap.h` header file provides the essential APIs applications need to interact with the **Bluetooth Generic Access Profile (GAP)**. GAP defines how Bluetooth devices discover each other, connect, and communicate in a secure manner. Understanding this header is crucial for developing any Zephyr-based Bluetooth application.

## Core Concepts

* **Roles**: Bluetooth GAP defines various roles a device can assume, primarily including:
    * **Broadcaster**: A device that only sends advertising data (e.g., a beacon).
    * **Observer**: A device that only scans for advertising data.
    * **Central**: A device that scans for and connects to peripheral devices (e.g., a smartphone connecting to Bluetooth headphones).
    * **Peripheral**: A device that can be connected to by a central device (e.g., Bluetooth headphones).
    
* **Operations & Device Interactions**
    * **Advertising & Scanning**:
        * **Advertising**: Advertising: Devices transmit advertising packets containing information like their name and service UUIDs, making themselves discoverable. This is typically performed by **Peripheral** and **Broadcaster** roles.
        * **Scanning**: Devices listen for and parse advertising packets sent by other devices. This is a primary action for **Central** and **Observer** roles.
    * **Connection**: Once devices discover each other and aim to communicate, they establish and manage a connection. GAP handles the lifecycle of these connections. This primarily involves **Central** and **Peripheral** roles.
        * **Pairing & Bonding**:
            * **Pairing**: The process of establishing shared secret keys for secure communication.
            * **Bonding**: Persisting the keys generated during pairing so that future secure connections can be established without re-pairing.
* **Address Types**: Bluetooth devices use addresses to uniquely identify themselves. Common address types include:
    * **Public Address**: A globally unique IEEE EUI-48 address. It's predominantly associated with Classic Bluetooth, also known as BR/EDR (Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate) connections.
    * **Random Address**: Widely used in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), random addresses can be:
        * **Static Random Address**: Persists across device resets but differs from a public address.
        * **Resolvable Private Address (RPA)**: A dynamic, frequently changing address that enhances privacy. It can be resolved to a device's real identity using a pre-shared Identity Resolving Key (IRK), making devices harder to track.
        * **Non-Resolvable Private Address (NRPA)**: A randomly generated address that offers no resolution mechanism, ideal for scenarios where no tracking is desired.

## Key API Functions (from `zephyr/bluetooth/gap.h` and related)

While `zephyr/bluetooth/gap.h` itself exposes a limited number of direct APIs, it defines structures and macros relevant to GAP. Actual GAP operations are often performed by combining APIs from `bluetooth/bluetooth.h` and implicitly using definitions from `bluetooth/gap.h`. Here are some common GAP-related operations you'll frequently encounter in Zephyr Bluetooth development:
### 1. Initializing the Bluetooth Stack

```c
int bt_enable	(	bt_ready_cb_t	cb	)	
```
The bt_enable() function is the essential starting point for any Bluetooth application in Zephyr. You must call this function before attempting any other Bluetooth operations that require communication with the local Bluetooth hardware.
* **Parameters**  
**cb**:  
    Give it a **callback** function: Your program continues running, and Zephyr tells that function when Bluetooth is ready. This is what we call asynchronous operation â€“ tasks happening in the background without blocking your main program flow.  
    Give it **NULL**: Your program pauses and waits until Bluetooth is ready before moving on. This is a synchronous operation. 

* **Returns**
Zero on success or (negative) error code otherwise.
* **example**
    ```ini
    # in prj.conf file
    # Logger module
    CONFIG_LOG=y
    #  Include the Bluetooth LE stack in your project
    CONFIG_BT=y
    ```
    ```c
    # in .c file
    #include <zephyr/bluetooth/bluetooth.h>
    #include <zephyr/bluetooth/gap.h> 
    int err;

        /* Enable the Bluetooth LE stack */
        err = bt_enable(NULL);
        if (err) {
            LOG_ERR("Bluetooth init failed (err %d)\n", err);
            return; // Handle error appropriately
        }

        LOG_INF("Bluetooth initialized\n");
    ```	
### 2. Configuring Advertising Parameters
